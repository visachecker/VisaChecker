# VisaChecker Development Process

## Status updates
### Team workflow
Status updates are to be provided asynchronously in respective issue's comments.

Once a week (on Sunday) team has a meeting, where: 
 * Current project status is discussed 
 * Workflow/development ideas are refined (retrospective)
 * Next development iteration is planned (planning)
 
## Development

Branch names must contain issue number in the beginning. No direct pushes to `main` branch are allowed. Details: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow
